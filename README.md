# The Far Away App

### Introduction

This project was one of the very first projects that I've created while I was learning about React.
<br><br>
The project's similar to a TODO List project, but as I rewrite the project I changed the context to a travel list. Besides that, I've applied some styles to make the application looks good. <br/>

---

The purpose of this project was to apply and understand some React concepts like: State manipulation, props, events, derived state and creating controlled elements.
<br><br>

The features that you will find in this app are: 

- Add new item.
- Mark the item as packed.
- Sort items by description, input order or packed status.
- Remove items.
- Clear all list of items.
